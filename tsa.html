        I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life
        in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of
        good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and
        processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry,
        and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school,
        community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will
        accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories
        that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for
        safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to
        develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for
        other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express
        my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better
        each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God,
        and my fellow Americans.

        TSA’s membership includes more than 250,000 middle and high school
        students across the United States. TSA is supported by educators,
        parents, and business leaders who believe in the need for a
        technologically literate society. Chapters also are committed to a
        national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups
        in the community.

      <p class="creed">
        TSA recognizes the value of strong leadership skills, and offers a
        customized leadership program, LEAP—which stands for “Leadership.
        Education. Achievement. Personal Growth.” Through this comprehensive
        program, student members develop leadership skills to apply to their
        future academic and professional careers. Members have the opportunity
        to hold leadership roles through elected offices at the chapter, state,
        and national levels, as well as through serving on working committees.
